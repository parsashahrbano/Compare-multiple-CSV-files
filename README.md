This repository contains a Python script that compares multiple CSV files cell-by-cell and extracts the maximum value from each corresponding cell across the files. The script reads in multiple CSV files, compares each cell in the same position, and records the highest value from each set of comparisons. The resulting data, which contains the maximum values from all the CSVs, is saved into a new CSV file. This tool is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to consolidate the most significant or highest values from multiple data sources into a single dataset for further analysis or reporting.
